# Web-design
This project is a prototype for my final web-design assignment. The goal was to play with hierarchy and contrast in order to create a usable website. I decided to make a redesign of the moodle student environment.

## Design
Before I started I created a content inventorisation of the website. After that I created user scenarios beased on the two users I am designing this website for.

### Marijn
Marijn has a physical condition that makes it hard for him to precisely control his muscles. Despite this condition he’s the chief technical architect at a large tech company. When he uses the computer he likes to think first and type later. He also prefers not to use his mouse or trackpad whenever possible.

#### Test

### Vienna
Vienna is a CMD student that is attending the Web Development Minor. She wants interfaces to be usable but look pretty at the same time. When she uses the website she wants the most important information to be easy to reach, not in 8 clicks like the current website.

### Scenarios
#### Scenario 1
##### Goal
The user wants to know how well he is doing in the minor Web Development. He is wondering he’s completely finished with past courses, or if he still has some work to do. 

##### Method
The user navigates to the student website and immediately sees how he’s doing. A progressbar indicates what courses he has finished and which ones still require some attention.

#### Scenario 2
##### Goal
The user doesn’t know what is expected of him. He wants to figure out what he has to do and when he has to finish it.

##### Method
The user navigates to the student website and opens the course page. This page contains information about the course and the expectations.

#### Scenario 3
##### Goal
The user is looking for extra resources to learn more about a certain subject. He recalls an article that his teacher mentioned in his last lecture.

##### Method (unresolved)
The user opens the student website and navigates to the sources page and filters the result to match the subject.

#### Scenario 4
##### Goal
The user wants to contact one of his teachers. He’s looking for an email address.

##### Method
He navigates to the ‘Team’ section where he is greeted by the faces of his teachers and corresponding contact information.

#### Scenario 5
##### Goal
The user is looking for inspiration for his current project. He’s wondering what students made last year.

##### Method (unresolved)
On the course page he navigates to the ‘Inspiration’ section.

### Design principles
#### Hierarchy
I tried to bloat the elements and maintain hierarchy at the same time.

#### Contrast
With colors I tried to create huge contrast that makes differentiating elements super easy. Focus and hover states are hard to miss and it's super clear where you are on the page, even if you don't use a mouse.

#### Conserve attention
Obvious focus states were super important to me throughout this project. To me it got to the point where it looks pretty bizar, but you can't say it isn't obvious where you are on the page.
