## Demo

[View prototype](http://netjs.nl/WD1/)

## Principles

### 6. One primary action per screen

Progressive disclosure makes seperating primary actions easy. Every state of the form has it's own primary action.

### 7. Keep secondary actions secondary

The primary action of each page is highlighted using size and color. Secondary actions are clearly secondary.

### 14. Progressive disclusore

I divided the form into 5 parts. Each part has it's own state. This way the user is never confronted with more input fields than necessary

## Testing

### Test 1 - Jelle Overbeek

* Lack of feedback when changing state
* Price is not obvious enough
* The destination is not clear in the last states

### Test 2 - Vienna Meijer

* Contrast in the buttons is unclear
* What if you travel with multiple passengers
* It's still ask for a return date if you pick single trip.

## Modifications

* [x] Added plane animation for extra feedback
* [x] Made the price larger and added a blue background
* [x] Made origin and destination larger in the ticket views
* [x] Used colors with more contrast for highlights and buttons
* [x] Added option to add multiple passengers
