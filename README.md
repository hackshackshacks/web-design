## Principles
### 6. One primary action per screen
Progressive disclosure makes seperating primary actions easy. Every state of the form has it's own primary action.
### 7. Keep secondary actions secondary
The primary action of each page is highlighted using size and color. Secondary actions are clearly secondary.
### 14. Progressive disclusore
I divided the form into 5 parts. Each part has it's own state. This way the user is never confronted with more input fields than necessary
